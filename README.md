<h1> Introduction </h1>
This is the readers guide for my portfolio created for the Applied Data Science minor at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.
Below are the criteria from the scoring matrix with detailed information about each criteria.

<h2> Datacamp </h2>
All datacamp courses except for one were completed. The one that was not completed was "_Time Series Analysis with Python_".
Outside of the assigned datacamp courses, roughly 1/4 of another course, "_Spoken Language Processing in Python_", was also completed.

<h2> Reflection and evaluation </h2>
<h3> Reflection on own contribution to the project </h3>
Situation: Our project group consisted of 6 members, and we worked with audio data to determine whether a audio clip contains conversation or not.
Task: My tasks in the group varied, early on there was a lot of hands-on coding, but as our priorities shifted, I found myself taking on a lot of presentations and other communication duties. 
Action: For the presentations I was a part of, I created a lot of the slides (even some other people's) along with the overall layout of the powerpoints. I helped other group members in taking care of the Scrum board on Taiga, and during the period in which I was scrummaster I took care of this mostly single-handedly. The code I wrote 
Result: ...
Reflect: The contributions I made to the project gave me a much better understanding of data science as a whole. While I am not ready to explore a career in the field, I have a strong feeling that the techniques and methods used in this minor will be of use to me in a professional setting. I regret not being part of the learning lab our group gave, since it would have been a good chance to expand my own knowledge.
