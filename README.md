Portfolio for applied data science minor

<h1> Introduction </h1>
This is the readers guide for my portfolio created for the Applied Data Science minor at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.
Below are the criteria from the scoring matrix with detailed information about each criteria.

<h2> Datacamp </h2>
All datacamp courses except for one were completed. The one that was not completed was *Time Series Analysis with Python*.
Outside of the assigned datacamp courses, roughly 1/4 of another course, *Spoken Language Processing in Python*, was also completed.

<h2> Reflection and evaluation </h2>

- Situation:  Our project group consisted of 6 members, and we worked with audio data to determine whether a audio clip contains conversation or not. We all worked together to ensure everyone would get hands-on experience with every aspect of the project work, although this was hard to realize and in the end some work ended up being unevenly distributed. Since I don't have a great deal of experience writing code, I was a little out of the loop at the end of the project when the code we had for our CNN's became very complex. However, at that point I took on other duties which helped the group as a whole but did give me as much programming experience as some others.

- Action: My tasks in the group varied, early on there was a lot of hands-on with coding simple models. One example is creating a Logistic Regression model that ended up being the first real algorithm we used, since it had the best results at that stage. Later on I started exploring datasets and drew up some requirements and comparisons for the datasets we ended up using. As the groups priorities shifted, I found myself taking on a lot of presentations and other communication duties along with writing the paper, since we had other people who were simply better at crunching code and it became a matter of time in the final stages. I also helped David & Maria who gave the learning lab feedback and suggestions for topics for them to cover, however I didn't end up taking part in presenting our learning lab. 


- Result: For the presentations I was a part of, I created a lot of the slides along with the overall layout of the powerpoints. I helped other group members in taking care of the Scrum board on Taiga, and during the period in which I was scrummaster I took care of this mostly single-handedly. The code I wrote early on was a simple logistic regression model that was later converted to take audio data as input, however at that point the model also had to change since RFC gave better accuracy. My work on the dataset helped us get good data quite early on the project, which I see as a great benefit for our neural networks

- Reflect: The contributions I made to the project gave me a much better understanding of data science as a whole. While I am not ready to explore a career in the field, I have a strong feeling that the techniques and methods used in this minor will be of use to me in a professional setting. I regret not being a bigger part of the learning lab our group gave, since it would have been a good chance to expand my own knowledge.
