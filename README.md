<h1> Introduction </h1>
This is the readers guide for my portfolio created for the Applied Data Science minor at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.
Below are the criteria from the scoring matrix with detailed information about each criteria.

<h2> Datacamp </h2>
All datacamp courses except for one were completed. The one that was not completed was "_Time Series Analysis with Python_".
Outside of the assigned datacamp courses, roughly 1/4 of another course, "_Spoken Language Processing in Python_", was also completed.

<h2> Reflection and evaluation </h2>
<h3> Reflection on own contribution to the project </h3>
- Our project group consisted of 6 members, and we worked with audio data to determine whether a audio clip contains conversation or not. We all worked together to ensure everyone would get hands-on experience with every aspect of the project work, although this was hard to realize and in the end a lot of work ended up being unevenly distributed. The uneven distribution is not necessarily a bad thing, since all group members were working on important things. However I think ideally the workload could have been more optimized<br>

- My tasks in the group varied, early on there was a lot of hands-on with coding simple models, later on I was working on the datasets a lot. As the groups priorities shifted, I found myself taking on a lot of presentations and other communication duties along with writing the paper, since we had other people who were simply better at crunching code. <br>

- For the presentations I was a part of, I created a lot of the slides along with the overall layout of the powerpoints. I helped other group members in taking care of the Scrum board on Taiga, and during the period in which I was scrummaster I took care of this mostly single-handedly. The code I wrote early on was a simple logistic regression model that was later converted to take audio data as input, however at that point the model also had to change since RFC gave better accuracy.
- Result: ...
- Reflect: The contributions I made to the project gave me a much better understanding of data science as a whole. While I am not ready to explore a career in the field, I have a strong feeling that the techniques and methods used in this minor will be of use to me in a professional setting. I regret not being part of the learning lab our group gave, since it would have been a good chance to expand my own knowledge.
